### Lessons Learned

## Technical Aspects

Ren'Py stands out as a user-friendly framework with robust graphical capabilities, making it an excellent choice for graphic designers and storytellers alike. Its seamless integration of sound and images simplifies the process of bringing narratives to life. However, while Ren'Py allows for the incorporation of Python code, it falls short in executing raw Python logic, limiting its flexibility.

Despite its strengths, Ren'Py's suitability for dynamic game content, such as collision detection and timers, is somewhat lacking. Integrating libraries like Pygame to address these shortcomings often introduces dependency issues, complicating the development process. In such cases, opting for a more versatile -and already known/experienced- programming language (raw java, python) may prove advantageous.

Moreover, navigating and resolving bugs proved to be a time-consuming endeavor, often exceeding initial estimates. This highlights the importance of factoring in ample time for bug fixing during the development cycle. Each new feature implementation inevitably brings its share of bugs, underscoring the need for thorough testing and debugging procedures.

## Process Aspects

Making a project should involve team members. Despite using boards, there were instances where I deviated from the plan, whether due to new ideas or alternative design approaches. This led to losing focus on unrelated parts of the project.

To manage all project aspects effectively, I found myself investing excessive time and concentration. Balancing programming with board management proved challenging, often resulting in difficulty resuming coding tasks after switching contexts. Additionally, allocating significant time to itch.io implementation led to insufficient time for integrating the miner-field feature into the game.

In hindsight, distributing roles among team members would have facilitated smoother project management. Solo execution proved to be significantly challenging, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts in project development.
